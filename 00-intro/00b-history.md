## Quick History

> Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process, "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight without all the extra concepts involved?"

> Vue was originally released in February 2014.

> Vue is supported by corporate sponsors and people like you and me. On Patreon, vue currently receives $15,857 per month
